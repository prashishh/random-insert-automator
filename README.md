#### Introduction

Suppose you want to insert thousands dummy data to your table, how would you do it? Don't tell me you are going use the archaic method of inserting every individual row? 

[Insert-random-automator][githublink] automates this process of inserting X number of rows into your table randomly. This project is an extension of [randomizer][randomizerlink] so it shares some common codes.
